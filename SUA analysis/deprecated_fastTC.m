function [TCA2B, TCB2A] = fastTC(spike_matrix, lags)
%% by Mattia

% this version is like the cumulative one (not single bins) but does not
% need "sequential" values for lags, you don't give maxlag, but rather a
% series of lags

% inputs:
% spike_matrix: units * time 
% lags: single lags at which you want the coeff to be computed
% units as the spike_matrix

% output:
% Tiling Coefficient: given a matrix with a, b, c ... k-1, k units, the output will be
% in the form of ab, ac, ad ..., ak-1, ak, bc, bd ... kk-2, kk-1
% Tiling CoefficientB2A: as above but from B to A, not from A to B -> ba,
% bc, bd ....

% this piece of code is a bit messy, but basically I am first scaling up
% the matrix. To have it in the right order I have to vectorize it,
% transpose it, repeat it, reshape it and finally permute it...
% the final outcome is that for every lag there is a square matrix in which
% the value indicates the total amount of time tiled by the spike train on
% the "receiving" end. Everything is then normalized by the length of spike
% matrix (so you have a proportion)
% ex. for lag = 1, it will be [A, A, A; B, B, B; C, C, C], where the
% capital letters indicate the norm amount of time tiled by that spike train

coefficients = reshape(coefficients(:), [], numel(lags) * 2, 1);
% get rid of the values that correspond to the tcoeff of each spike train
% to itself. they were originally on the diag of each (lag) matrix. so
% delete every *num_units + 1* row starting from the first one
coefficients(1 : num_units + 1 : end, :) = [];

% compute indexes that belong to A2B and those that belong to B2A (they are
% intermingled in the coefficient matrix as is now). Specifically.. the
% first num_units-1 are B2A, then 1 that is A2B, then num_units-2 that are
% B2A, 2 A2B, num_units-3 that are A2B .... 1 that is A2B, num_units-1 that
% is B2A.
% there is a simmetry with cycle = num_units. if you put in a
% n_units*n_units-1 matrix, the tril of it corresponds to the B2A indexes.
% Then you just have to rearrange the order (the part that is done with
% sort(rows). Hard to exaplain with words, easier to code
