# Welcome to the Opatz Lab ROSA toolbox

Welcome to the Hanganu-Opatz ROSA toolbox! The goal is to collect all the most relevant scripts for preprocessing/analysis that one might need as a lab member. 
IMPORTANT: everything here is under development, and should be treated like that. If you find something that needs improving, please let me know or open an issue. If you suspect to have found a mistake, please let me know ASAP!

In the folder [Wrappers](https://github.com/mchini/HanganuOpatzToolbox/tree/master/Wrappers) you can find a few examples of "main scripts" that wrap around there functions.
Most of the scripts that are uploaded here should be commented enought to be readable/usable, but please let me know if something is unclear/should be better documented.
More detailed documentation will be provided in the next weeks.

If you wrote a function (or series of functions) that you think could be of general interest for the lab, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it to the toolbox. Just make sure that is commented and intelligible for everyone.
Similarly, if you would like some other (series of) functions in the toolbox, ask me and I'll do my best to add them.

The best way for you to take advantage of this repository would be to fork it.
Here is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on GitHub. Perhaps check out also [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't want to use the command line.
