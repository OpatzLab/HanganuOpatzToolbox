% example script on how to detect oscillations in discontinuous signal
% using:
% - normalized squared signal (NSS) 
% - thresholding the baseline
% - merging neighboring events
% - thresholding the peaks (absolute and relative) - the absolute part is the
%   main difference with the old version. The specific of this value has to be
%   adjusted depending on the area that is studied (e.g. much higher thresholds
%   for OB than PFC). The values given here work for PFC.
% - discarding events with short duration
