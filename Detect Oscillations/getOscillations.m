function [oscillations] = getOscillations(experiment, signal, fs, freq_band, rel_thresholds, ...
    abs_thresholds, durations, save_data, repeatCalc, results_folder, channel, verbose)
%    by Mattia based on buszaki code:
%    https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/blob/master/detectors/detectEvents/bz_FindRipples.m
%    similar to getRipples but includes also an absolute threshold to make
%    comparisons across ages more consistent

%    Oscillations are detected using the normalized squared signal (NSS) by
%    thresholding the baseline, merging neighboring events, thresholding
%    the peaks (abs and rel), and discarding events with short duration.

%   inputs:
%           - experiment: as usual
%           - signal: on which to detect oscillations -> 1 x whatever
%           - fs: sampling frequency of signal (standard: 1000 Hz) -> 1000
%           - freq_band : frequencies in which to detect oscillations (4-20
%               Hz is standard) -> [4 20]
%           - rel_thresholds: thresholds for oscillations beginning/end 
%               and peak, in multiples of the stdev (standard = [2 5]);
%           - abs_threshold: absolute peak threshold
%           - durations: min inter-oscillation interval and max oscillation
%               duration, in ms (standard = [1000 500]).
%           - save_data: as usual
%           - repeatCalc: as usual
