function [slope, intercept] = getLFPslope(power_spectrum, freq, freq4slope, to_plot)
%% Calculate power law decay exponent (1/f slope)

% By Mattia, based on Gao et al., 2017: Inferring synaptic excitation/inhibition balance from field potentials.

% INPUTS:
% power_spectrum: ´      vector of LFP power as e.g. in the output of
%                        pWelchSpectrum
% freq:                  frequency vector corresponding to the power
%                        spectrum (has to have the same length)
% freq4slope:            frequencies at which to calculate the 1/f slope.
%                        In Gao et al., 30-50Hz and 40-60Hz are used.
%                        Ideally, it should be a portion of the power
%                        spectrum in which there are no bona-fide
%                        oscillations (the power spectrum is flat on the
%                        log-log scale). Input Example [30 50]
% to_plot:               to visually inspect the fit (1=yes, 0 or no input = no)

% OUTPUT:
% slope:                 power law decay exponent (1/f slope)
% intercept:             intercept of the fit. See Haller et al., 2018 on
%                        why this could be interesting (Parameterizing
%                        Neural Power Spectra)
